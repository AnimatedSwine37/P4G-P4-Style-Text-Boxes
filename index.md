## P4 Style Text Boxes

### Details
Makes the text boxes in Persona 4 Golden PC look more like those in Persona 4. 

To download the mod and for more details check out its Gamebanana page.

### Modularity
This mod is modular and as such certain parts of it can be used or not to your liking, to give an idea of how certain combinations will look you can use the comparison tool below. 

This does not contain all possible combinations as I didn't want to take 64+ screenshots, however it does contain some that I think would be common. 
Also, the Persona 4 screenshot is using a widescreen hack to make it closer to P4G PC (this is what I used for reference).

These comparisons also include options for my other mod, Hidden Field Names, which I think complements this nicely (and also works nicely on its own).

### Comparison
Note that if a checkbox is greyed out it means there's no screenshot of your currently selected modules with it, try disabling some of them to enable it.

### Support Me
I have worked very hard to make this as close as possible to Persona 4 so if you particularly appreciate this or any of my mods you can [buy me a ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/animatedswine) (although just looking at and downloading my mods is already very helpful).

Also, if this is somehow the first mod of mine you've seen, I've made many others that you can check out at my [Gamebanana profile](https://gamebanana.com/members/submissions/mods/1742760). You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnimatedSwine37) where I post about all my new releases as well as some sneak peaks of upcoming mods.

### Special Thanks
The comparison tool was made using [img-comparison-slider](https://github.com/sneas/img-comparison-slider), thanks to them for the really cool open source tool. 
This mod was motivated from conversations on the [Persona Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/naoto) server so thanks to anyone on there who gave feedback and helped (particularly Kris!).
